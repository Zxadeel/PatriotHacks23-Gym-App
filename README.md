# PixelGym

PixelGym is a gamified workout tracker app that turns exercise into an 8-bit RPG. It helps you creates smart workout routines to achieve your goals while measuring your progress. The app was developed during the 2023 PatriotHacks hackathon at George Mason University, by a team of four students. Built using React Native, this application combines the thrill of leveling up in a virtual world with the gains you make in the real world. We had to learn React Native in 24 hours to build this project, so it was a challenging project for our entire team. This project was selected as one of the winners of PatriotHacks 2023.

## About

PixelGym has several unique features that you don't find in most workout apps.

- **Choose Your Focus**: Select the specific muscle groups you want to work out, so you can get a workout routine tailored for your own goals.

- **Level Up Your Workouts**: Earn XP by completing your workouts. The harder you work, the more your character levels up.

- **Motivational Timer**: Our built-in timer motivates you, while keeping track of your progress, XP is calculated based on total time spent exercising, making it difficult to cheat the system.

- **Future Features:** PixelGym is always evolving. Planned features include character customization, new exercises, improved timers, non-weightlifting workouts, and even a store where you can purchase pixelated pets.
